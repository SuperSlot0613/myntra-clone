##  Myntra Clone and Online cloths shopping website

This Myntra Clone pack is made using React. The data on the website is directly linked to a code. Any changes to the website can be made in the code. The changes will then be reflected on to the website page. This allows you to customize your own personal web page that can be used for applying to jobs or other personal uses.

## To run the backend server
To run the backend server go to the backend folder and run "nodemon app.js" command 

## 1. Make sure you have NODE installed!

Firstly, you will need to download the latest version of Node by <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">CLICKING HERE</a>

## 2. Install Dependancies

Next, you need to install all the dependancies using:

```npm install```

Once this is done, you can start the app with:

```npm start```

## 3. (OPTIONAL) Replacing images and/or fonts

If you want to display your own pictures then you have to replace the code.

## 4. Finalising Resume

Once all the formatting and data input is finalised, run `npm run build`. This will create a dedicated build folder.

## 5. Host Website Online

1) Open the build folder in the finder screen
2) Go to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> and set up a profile
3) Go to the 'Sites Tab'
4) Simply Drag and drop the 'Build' Folder into the designated upload space
5) The app will begin deploying & the deployment URL will be presented!

ðŸš€ BOOM, you are now LIVE!!!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
